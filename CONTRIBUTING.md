# How to contribute

## Reporting a bug

First, **make sure the bug hasn't already been reported** by searching GitHub's issues section.

If no existing issue exists, go ahead and create one. **Please be sure to include all of the following:**

1. A clear, descriptive title (ie. "A bug" is *not* a good title).
2. As much detail about the issue you're running into as possible.
3. The OS that you're using.



## Asking a question

Before asking, please **make sure the question hasn't already been asked** by searching GitHub's issues section.
